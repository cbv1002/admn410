			<h2> Our history</h2>
			<p> In 2019, founder Tina Abujaoude was looking for a way to get rid of her old laptop and other electronics that were piling up. Looking into she realized that the places that could dispose of them, just sent the electronics to communities that would take them apart for different parts to resell, and learned about how the electronic waste did more harm than good to these communities and the land around them. Learning that the wires would cause sickness and the run off waste from these would get into the water supply and dirt, leaving them unsalvagable, Tina decided that there had to be a better way for these electronics to be made. With help from our team, Better Wires was created and since then we have been growing exponentially and spreading our story with likeminded people who want to make a change in our modern world.</p>
